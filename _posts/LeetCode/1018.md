### 1018. Binary Prefix Divisible By 5

### Description

Given an array A of 0s and 1s, consider N_i: the i-th subarray from A[0] to A[i] interpreted as a binary number (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit.)

Return a list of booleans answer, where answer[i] is true if and only if N_i is divisible by 5.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [0,1,1]
Output: [true,false,false]
Explanation: 
The input numbers in binary are 0, 01, 011; which are 0, 1, and 3 in base-10.  Only the first number is divisible by 5, so answer[0] is true.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: [1,1,1]
Output: [false,false,false]
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: [0,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [true,false,false,false,true,false]
```

### Solution
```
class Solution:
    def prefixesDivBy5(self, A: List[int]) -> List[bool]:
        answer = [0 for i in A]       
        for i in range(len(A)):
            temp = answer[i-1]*2 + A[i]
            answer[i] = temp % 5
        return [i==0 for i in answer]
```

### Detail

1. 注意左边是高位
2. Answer[0:i]  = (Answer[0:i-1]*2 + A[i])%5
